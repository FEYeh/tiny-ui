# Radio

A single entry component. If there are only two options, consider using the [`Switch`](/components/switch) component.

## Scenario

- Used to select a single state from multiple options.
- The difference from Select is that Radio is visible to the user and can facilitate the comparison of choice, which means there shouldn't be too many of them.

## Usage

```js
import { Radio } from 'tiny-ui';

const { Group } = Radio;
```
